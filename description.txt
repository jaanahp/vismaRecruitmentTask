Task was to create a class which checks whether the URI it receives as an input satisfies the requirements 
set for it and if it does, the class returns certain elements it gets from the URI as key-value pairs. The 
purpose of this is to validate that the request is coming from the right place and the returned key-value 
pairs could be used to validate the request.

My main challenge was with the client, as during my previous degree proper terminology wasn't used, so I am
not entirely sure if my interpretation of client is what was wanted. I also wondered whether I should 
check that payment number is six digits long and document id is seven characters and includes both numbers and 
letters as in the examples given, but as this was not required in the directions, I left it out.

I would further improve my solution by improving error handling especially in the method that returns URI
parameters, refactoring the validateUri -function a little and removing unnecessary items from uriSplitList
which is created from URI sections.
